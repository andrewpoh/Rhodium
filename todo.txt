To Do:

* Make squared deviation an aggregation metric
* Increase sharing of computations and data structures
* Add support for weights
* Test regression tree prediction
* Test parsing on large dataset
* Profile regression tree prediction
* Create regression tree training
* Profile regression tree training
* Create random forest algorithm
* Profile random forest training and prediction
* Add proximity and importance metrics
* Remove redundant (dataframe etc creation) methods
* Move test data into separate files
* Create QuickCheck tests

* Maybe convert split generator into unfold

Done:
* Create double split generator
* Adapt algorithms to operate on row subsets
* Implement squared deviation metric
