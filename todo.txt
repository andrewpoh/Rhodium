To Do:

* Move test data into separate files
* Increase sharing of computations and data structures
* Add support for weights
* Test regression tree prediction
* Test parsing on large dataset
* Profile regression tree prediction
* Create regression tree training
* Profile regression tree training
* Create random forest algorithm
* Profile random forest training and prediction
* Add proximity and importance metrics
* Remove redundant (dataframe etc creation) methods
* Create QuickCheck tests

Maybe not:
* Make squared deviation an aggregation metric (requires 2 passes)
* Maybe convert split generator into unfold (int split doesn't look like unfold)
* Run HLint on the code (done, do it again later)

Done:
* Create double split generator
* Adapt algorithms to operate on row subsets
* Implement squared deviation metric
